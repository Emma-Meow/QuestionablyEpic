/**
 * This function will build a spell sequence for a specific ramp. There are three key ramp types included:
 * Boon Ramps (Evang / Spirit Shell options): Includes applicators, specific trinket timings and a dynamic rotation that includes haste. 
 * Fiend Ramps (+ Mindgames if Venthyr + Evang / Shell options)
 * Mini Ramps: Includes a smaller number of applicators and then double radiance + DPS spells. Includes Mindgames if Venthyr. 
 * 
 * @param {*} type Type describes which of the above ramp types to build a sequence for.
 * @param {*} applicators The number of single target atonement applicators to apply. Usually 10 for an Evang ramp and a little less for a mini-ramp but you can set this yourself.
 * @param {*} trinkets A list of on-use trinkets that the player is using. We can sequence these wherever we want. Generally if we're using a 2-3 minute on-use trinket we'll combine
 *                      it with Boon and if we're using a 1.5 minute trinket we'll use it with every Evang / Shell ramp. The system also supports running two 3 minute trinkets and 
 *                      alternating them.
 * @param {*} haste A players current haste in whatever set they're using. This is mostly just used for building our Boon sequence.
 * @param {*} playstyle Playstyles currently include Kyrian Evangelism and Kyrian Spirit Shell but more are coming very soon, and building in new playstyles should be fairly fast and easy.
 * @param {*} specialSpells Special spells are those that can change our ramp in some way. Rapture is the most prominent current example.
 * @returns The function returns a sequence of spells (which might include trinket uses).
